"# concrete_cracks_detection" 
inside concrete_cracks_detection you should build the file structure shown 
$./concrete_cracks_detection .
#Folder tree
.
  *[concrete_cracks_detection](./concrete_cracks_detection)
     * [content](./concrete_cracks_detection/content)
         * [concrete_images](./concrete_cracks_detection/content/concrete_images)
            * [train](./concrete_cracks_detection/content/concrete_images/train)
            * [validation](./concrete_cracks_detection/content/concrete_images/validation)
            * [test](./concrete_cracks_detection/content/concrete_images/test)
     
Thus content should be placed inside concrete_cracks_detection ( root folder). Inside content place concrete_images inside concrete_images the three folders train, validation, test

You can put the archive folder inside content or manually extract its two folders, Negative and Positive, into concrete_images

Otherwise just place the archive folder you get in your google drive and use the file path option for it if working with colabs
